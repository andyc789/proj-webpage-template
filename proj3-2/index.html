        <p>
            This project built off of the previous project by having us implement reflective and refractive 
            surfaces, as well as implementing a thin-lens camera as opposed to the default pinhole camera. 
            Reflective surfaces were sampled by setting the pdf to 1 and getting the incoming vector by 
            inverting the x and y of the outgoing vector, then returning reflectance / abs_cos_theta(incoming vector). 
            Refractive surfaces were implemented by following the formulas in the spec to calculate the incoming vector, 
            then sampling by calculating (transmittance / abs_cos_theta(*wi) / eta^2). When implementing refractive 
            surfaces, we ran into an issue where the refractive sphere would appear white. This ended up being due 
            to the fact that our refractive formula only accounted for when rays entered the refractive material. 
            This was fixed by setting n and eta to ior when wo.z was negative. To implement the thin-lens camera, 
            we first calculated the focus position by multiplying the focalDistance and the original camera 
            position and then converting them to world coordinates. Then we calculated the lens position using 
            uniform sampling to get the position. Finally, we found the normalized direction from the lens 
            position to the focal position and created a ray that goes from the lens position + the original 
            position in the normalized direction. Andy worked on the initial implementation for part 1 of the 
            project, and Akhil debugged part 1 and worked on part 4.

            At m=0, only the area light is visible.
            At m=1, the walls are visible, but the ceiling and balls are black. The reflective

            At m=2, the reflective ball reflects the walls and the ceiling is visible. The

            At m=3, the refractive ball can refract everything in the image except the reflection from the ball.
            The refractive ball still appears black in the reflective ball.
            At m=4, the refractive ball is no longer black in the reflection and the refractive ball
            appears brighter. There is also a bright spot in the bottom right corner.
            At m=5, both balls appear brighter.
            At m=100, the area light and its reflection, refractive ball and its reflection, and the

        </p>
        <p>
            At m=0, only the area light is visible because it is emitting the light directly. With no 
            ray bounces, only direct light sources will be visible.
            At m=1, the walls are visible, but the ceiling and balls are black. The reflective
            ball is reflecting the area light, but not the walls, because the light only gets
            to bounce once before hitting the camera, so only the light's reflection is shown. The light 
            does not have enough bounces to leave the refractive ball, so it appears black. The walls themselves  
            are visible because the light bounces off them directly, but they do not show up in the reflective 
            ball because the light does not have enough bounces to go from light -> wall -> reflect (need 2 bounces). 
            Similar logic explains why the ceiling appears black (light does not touch it directly).
            At m=2, the reflective ball reflects the walls and the ceiling is visible. The
            refractive ball is only refracting the light from the area light. The reflective ball 
            can now show the reflected walls and light because there are enough ray bounces 
            to do so. The refractive ball can now refract the light from the light source directly, but nothing else 
            This makes sense because to refract the light itself would require one less bounce than the objects that 
            the light is shining on. The ceiling's reflection is not visible yet because it does not receive light from 
            the area light directly.
            At m=3, the refractive ball can refract everything in the image except the reflection from the ball. 
            It cannot refract the reflection yet because there are not enough bounces (ex. light -> wall -> reflect 
            -> enter refractive ball -> exit refractive ball = 4 bounces). This also means that the refractive ball 
            still appears black in the reflective ball (going the other way still requires 4 bounces).
            At m=4, the refractive ball is no longer black in the reflection and the refractive ball
            appears brighter. There is also a bright spot in the bottom right corner caused by the additional 
            light from the reflective ball that is now going through the refractive ball as well.
            At m=5, both balls appear brighter. More light bounces will make the scene brighter and thus cause 
            the balls' reflection/refraction to appear brighter.
            At m=100, the area light and its reflection, refractive ball and its reflection, and the
            surrounding ceiling appear brighter. Since the light is allowed to bounce around so much,
            many parts of the image appear brighter.

            </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            With pinhole cameras, everything is in focus because the light comes from a single point. With a 
            thin-lens camera, objects can appear out of focus depending on the focal distance, which is the distance 
            between the lens and the plane of focus. The radius of the lens also affects the clarity of the image. 
            When the lens radius is large, the image appears blurrier because the image is created by uniformly 
            sampling the lens; if it is larger, this sampling will result in a less sharp image.
