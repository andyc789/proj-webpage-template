        <p>
            We implemented edge flip by drawing a diagram of 2 triangles before and after the flip. By labelling each
            halfedge, edge, vertex, and face, we were able to easily see how the neighbors would change with the flip,
            and reassign the neighbors of each halfedge accordingly. When implementing, even though some neighboring attributes
            would stay the same, we opted to reassign all neighbors from scratch, as though the mesh attributes were just created.
            This would make it easier to debug in the future, because it made it impossible to make any erroneous assumptions
            about already-existing neighbors.

        <p>
            We used a similar approach to task 4 for this problem. However, this task was much more complicated,
            as we needed to introduce many new mesh elements. As such, we needed to initialize completely some completely
            new mesh elements and assign pointers to them, rather than just reusing the old elements and reassigning values
            to those. In particular, the new vertex v4 had to have its position calculated by taking the midpoint of the edge
            being split. The convoluted nature of this problem led us to make some mistakes, which are covered in the debugging
            section.

        <p>
            Our first implementation had an issue where a hole would be created in the mesh with each split. After asking
            for advice, we suspected that the problem may have to do with an erroneous pointer in one of the halfedges. We
            were also concerned about setting the halfedge pointers for edges and faces, because there could be multiple
            answers, but it ended up not mattering as long as the halfedge specified was attached to the element in question.
            We tried to debug by looking over the code and comparing it to the diagram we drew, but we could not find the
            mistake after checking multiple times. In the end, we solved it by writing the reassignments from scratch to compare
            with our previous implementation, and we found that a halfedge was pointing to the wrong vertex. In the future, we
            should consider this approach earlier, as it is sometimes hard to find a single mistake in a convoluted problem like
            this.

        <b>
            Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
        </b>
        <p>
            We implemented loop subdivision by following the algorithm and advice in the spec. The process for
            loop subdivision involves first performing a 4-1 subdivison, then updating the positions of both old
            and new vertices. However, in the algorithm we implemented, we first calculated the updated positions
            of old and new vertices. We stored the new vertex positions in the edges' newPosition attribute that
            they would be created on, and the old vertex positions in an additional temporary attribute in the old
            vertices, newPosition. We found the adjacent vertex positions for both cases by using the halfedges to
            traverse the mesh, but finding the adjacent vertices for the old vertex was a bit trickier because it
            required a for loop and a running sum to accumulate their position values, traversing them in a counterclockwise
            direction. After calculating these values, we could split on all edges, then flip on the edges after checking if the
            edge was created by the split, and the vertices of the current edge's halfedge and that of the next for one new,
            one old vertex. From here, we could just iterate through a list of old vertices and update their positions to
            their newPosition attributes. We set the positions of the new vertices in the splitting portion because it was more
            convenient, as we had the edge that was being split on (containing the new vertex's position), as well as the vertex
            that was being created.

            Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
        </b>
        <p>
            Through multiple loop subdivisions, sharp corner and edges of the mesh become rounder. It seems like you
            can slightly reduce this effect by presplitting many times in a single area.

            Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.
        </b>
        <p>
            From testing, it seems like preprocessing with edge splits help flatten out the sides of the cube with multiple
            subdivisions. Additionally, from our tests, we found that if we first split, then flip the edges so they almost
            coincide with the already existing edges of the cube, the corners of the face would be more pronounced with
            subsequent subdivisions. Using these combined effects, it is possible to get a cube that is almost symmetrical
            through subdivision.
