        <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>
        <p>
            For this question, we rasterized triangles by iterating through each pixel within the width and height.
            We created a helper function that would take in a line and point, and determine whether the point was inside the line.
            We used this helper function to check whether the center of each pixel was inside or outside all 3 possible lines (p0->p1, p1->p2, p2->p0).
            If this were the case, we would rasterize the point in question with the passed in color. Since our algorithm just iterates over each
            possible point, checking whether it is within the triangle, it would not be any slower than checking each sample.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>
        <p>
            Supersampling is useful because it helps round out edges and remove jaggies. We implemented supersampling by scaling the
            original image up by a factor of sqrt(sample_size), and checking whether each pixel in the upscaled image was
            inside/outside the upscaled triangle. If this were the case, instead of rasterizing the point directly, we would update
            the sample buffer at the corresponding location with the color value. We accomplished this by adding 2 more nested for loops.
            These for loops would check each each NxN square of pixels corresponding to a single pixel of the original image.
            Our sample buffer was larger than the actual framebuffer by a factor of sample_size. This meant that there were sample_size elements
            in the sample buffer that would correspond to a single framebuffer element. Each of these sample_size elements would either be
            white (default) or the corresponding color that was passed in. In resolve_to_framebuffer(), we would take these elements and
            compute the average color, then fill in the framebuffer at the corresponding location with the computed average color value.
            The result of implementing supersampling was a smoother image when increasing the sampling rate, especially on edges that
            were very slightly slanted. The pixels were no longer clearly visible.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>
        <p>
            Barycentric coordinates are weights that can be attached to vertices of a triangle to interpolate
            coordinates from inside the triangle. In the image below, the triangle has red, green, and blue
            vertices, but using barycentric coordinates, the inside of the triangle appears to be smoothly
            blended. By using barycentric coordinates, the color of each location inside the triangle can be
            determined by the weight placed on each vertex. For example, if a location is closer to the red
            vertex, the weight attached to the color of the red vertex will be larger, resulting in a color
            closer to red.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>
        <p>
            Given the locations (x, y) of the 3 vertices of the triangle and their corresponding texture
            coordinates (u, v), we first calculated the barycentric coordinates for each point in the
            triangle, then used these weights to calculate the final (u, v) by applying them to the given
            (u0, v0), (u1, v1), (u2, v2). This vector was passed into our sample functions with level 0.
            For nearest pixel sampling, we multiplied the u and v passed in to the function by a factor
            of (width - 1) or (height - 1) to scale them with the texture map, then got the nearest texel
            to that scaled (u, v). For bilinear sampling, we first found the exact location (tx, ty) of the
            texture value to be sampled. By rounding (tx, ty) to the nearest texel, we found the nearest
            4 sample locations. We got the colors from these sample locations, then performed 2 horizontal
            lerps to get 2 colors, then 1 final vertical lerp to get our final color value.

        <p>
            These images illustrate how bilinear sampling results in more accurate and sharper image. 
            Because nearest sampling depends on surrounding pixels, it sometimes results in blurrier results.
            In the nearest sampling image, the pixel inspector for nearest sampling shows that the equator has 
            a width of 2 pixels. In the bilinear sampling image, the equator is shown to be 1 pixel wide, and
            the edges of the continents also appear more well-defined and less blurry.
        </p>

        <h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>
        <p>
            Level sampling is a way for the image to determine which level of the mipmap to 
            get texels from. We accomplished this in our code by finding du/dx, dv/dx, du/dy, 
            dv/dy by performing barycentric interpolation on the surrounding points inside the 
            triangle, then using the formula in lecture to find the level. Level sampling is useful 
            for texture mapping because it can help determine whether to use a blurred or sharp 
            texture, depending on the texture space displacement between pixels, which the level 
            is dependent on. 

            Pixel sampling is not as effective at antialiasing with nearest pixel sampling as it depends 
            on points that already exist, but is more effective with bilinear pixel sampling, which uses 
            nearby pixels to determine an intermediate color value relative to its position. It is not as 
            computationally expensive as supersampling, and does not require as much memory because only 
            one level of the mipmap is needed.

            Level sampling is an effective way to antialias, as it allows for blurring with large 
            jumps in texture space to avoid jaggies. Bilinear level sampling is slightly more computationally 
            intensive and accurate than nearest level sampling, as it computes a lerp between the values 
            from the two adjacent levels to get an intermediate value. While it is slightly slower than just sampling, 
            it is not very memory intensive, as each successive mipmap level has less pixels. 

            Supersampling is a strong way to antialias by softening edges, but is very intensive 
            computationally and is very slow, and requires a lot of memory because the size of the 
            sample buffer increases so drastically.
